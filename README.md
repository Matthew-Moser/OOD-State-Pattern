# OOD-State-Pattern
 Using the state pattern to demonstrate how an attack damage buff could work in a video game. I will likely go back to this after the class has finished and attempt to make a simple turn based battle game out of this. Probably won't be super fun/interesting, but it will be a good exercise in coding.
